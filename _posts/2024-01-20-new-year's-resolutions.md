A list of things to get done in 2024. Last updated on 2024/01/29<!--more-->

Last year's list was another failure since none of them got done. Couples of reasons. 

1. Things didn't happen as expected at the time the list was in plan. So no more motivations to get these tasks done.
2. Not disciplined and determined enough.
3. Items are broad and generic. Not measurable. Hard to track progress.

Time and tide wait for no man. This year things have to be improved. There are some changes for the list in this year.

1. The list will be revisited and modified over the year.
2. Items will be SMART objectives: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound.
3. For items failed to achieved after 3 attempts, will cross it out with specific note, and leave to next year's list. Replaced with a new item.
4. Go public my list, and share it to couple of my friends, so that would have more encourages to get things done.

Without further ado, in 2024 I want to achieve / improve the following 5C-dimensions:

* **Communication (C1)** 
* **Concentration (C2)**
* **Connection (C3)** 
* **Competence (C4)**
* **Characteristics (C5)**

The 2024's Resolutions are below.

Dimension | Resolution | Date Added | Date Modified | Reason | Status |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | :---: |
**Communication (C1)**| | | | | Opening|
**Concentration (C2)**| | | | | Opening|
**Connection (C3)**| | | | | Opening|
**Competence (C4)**| | | | | Opening|
**Courage (C5)**| | | | | Opening|

That's it for now.
