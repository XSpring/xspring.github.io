For people who by chance pass by this blog, see it interesting, and want to know more about its behind stories. Well, I assume none other than myself lol

### What is this blog about ?
A repository for my thoughts in QA format.

### Why do I start this blog ?
I have started to forget things recently. Not sure why. Age ? Depression ? Stress ? or maybe a combination of them.. So I need a place to document and store my thoughts and memories. For later references, if needed.

### Why go digital instead of papers ? 
More cost efficient, more convenient, more comfortable and more environmental friendly.

### Why in QA format ?
I am lazy to write long essay. English and writing are not my forte also. Plus, QA form helps me to organize thoughts better, and to quickly grase  the idea I want to look for. At least it works for me.

### Why now ?
I have thought about this in the past. However, couldn't commit to it. No time. Lazy. Now still same reasons. But more commitments as it one of my new year resolution in 2024.

### What are topics ?
Any topics I like. It's my personal blog anyway.

### How often do I update this blog ? 
I am looking forward to have at least 1 post per week. (2024-01-21)

Thanks for reading!
